The MIDIbox SID project is introduced at this webpage:
http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_sid.html


Please read also CHANGELOG.txt for the last changes.


Some precompiled setups are part of this package:
   o setup_6581.hex            (MBSID stuffed with 6581)
   o setup_8580.hex            (MBSID stuffed with 8580)
   o setup_tk.hex              (TK's Setup)
   o setup_mb6582.hex          (MB-6582 Setup)
   o setup_tk2.hex             (TK's Setup for his MB-6582)
   o setup_sammich_sid.hex     (Special setup for sammichSID)
   o setup_rack1u.hex          (Special setup for Xavier Hosxe 1U rack)


The required application upload procedure is described
under http://www.ucapps.de/mios_bootstrap_newbies.html


Infos for customization:
   o note that a main.asm file doesn't exist, instead, src/main.inc is
     included from the setup_*.asm files. src/main.inc doesn't need to be touched!
   o do your setup in setup_8580.asm or setup_6581.asm
     MIDIbox SID slaves will be detected automatically depending on the
     MIOS device ID
     The setup_tk.asm file is intented for TK's own setup and partly requires special
     hardware
